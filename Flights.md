## UBSEDS2

Launched from EMF 31/08/2014. Joint flight with CUSF (JOEY rtty/turbo)
and SUSF (UKHAS repeater).

AAA battery and surgically attached 16MHz crystal. Measured 80mA
current draw, no power saving for the ublox 6.

Revision C Atmel SAM D20 microcontrollor (bit-banged SPI)

140g free lift on a 100g Hwoyee.

4 hours battery life, much less than expected. Low temperatures?

Watchdog enabled, 64 seconds timeout (based on ULP32k oscillator, so
+-50%)
