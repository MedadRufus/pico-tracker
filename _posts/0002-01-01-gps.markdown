The MAX-M8C module is used for positioning. The _-M8C_ variant has a
1.65V - 3.6V supply but doesn't include a RTC crystal. The ARM Cortex
communicates over 9600 baud UART using the UBX protocol.

The module is set in flight mode (Platform Model = `AIRBOURNE
1G`). Whilst the module is capable of receiving two GNSS contellations
at once it is set to only receive GPS. This allows the receiver to be
set in power save mode (`lpMode = 1` in the `CFG RXM`
message). **TODO: Update this after experiments with advanced
powersave modes**

[HAB Supplies](http://ava.upuaut.net/store/index.php?route=product/product&path=59_64&product_id=108)
is a great supplier for this module.
