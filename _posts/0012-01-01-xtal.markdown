We use a temperature controlled oscillator (TXCO) from Epson to provide
a clock to both the [radio](#radio) and [ARM Cortex](#armcortex).

The Pin 1 marker is a perfect circle.

It has a supply voltage of 1.7V - 3.3V. This was one of the harder
parts for find for a 1.8V volt supply. The output waveform is
specified at 0.8Vpk-pk and in test it's about 0.9Vpk-pk. This is no problem
for the radio but ideally would be higher for the CLKIN pin of the ARM
Cortex. We've had no problems with a 1.8V supply, but at 3.3V the ARM
Cortex never locks on the clock. In this case the
[`USE_XOSC` option][usexosc] in firmware can be set false.

The frequency tolerance is given at ±2 parts-per-million (ppm) at
25°C, with ±1 ppm per year aging at 25°C. The temperature range is
given at -30°C to 85°C with another ±2 ppm variation over this
range. We've tested it to -55°C by dropping it unprotected into the
jet stream (as you do) and it got rather drifty (10 ppm??) before the
board cut out. **TODO: Cold chamber testing**
