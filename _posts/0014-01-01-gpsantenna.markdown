A 1/4 wave piece of
[guitar wire](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Ernie-Ball-Custom-Gauge-Guitar-Single-Strings-Electric-or-Acoustic-Pack-6-13-/360959212478
) is used for the GPS antenna. This has vertical
polarisation which means it will be 3dB down compared to a right-hand
circularly polarised antenna. However the antenna has such a clear
view of the sky that this isn't an issue. **TODO: Good picture**
