The tracker uses the Si4063/60 transmitter from Si-Labs, although the
Si446x series of transceivers is pin-compatible. With a 1.8V - 3.6V
supply and 142 - 1050MHz frequency range this transmitter is ideal.

The Si4060 specifies a max output power of +13dBm, and the Si4063
specifies +20dBm. Thus far we have used the Si4063 on a reduced power
setting to give +6dBm of output power as measured by a signal
analyser. **TODO: More testing to bring the output power up to the
+10dBm limit.**

For FSK modes (RTTY, Contestia) the radio is set in CW mode and the
`MODEM_FREQ_OFFSET` parameter is used to set the tone. The 16.369MHz
clock from the TCXO gives a frequency resolution of 7.8053 Hz in this
case.

For AFSK (APRS) the radio is set in 2GFSK mode and the
`MODEM_FREQ_DEV` parameter is used to set the FM deviation. GPIO1 is
then used in direct mode as a modulation input. The radio applies a
gaussian filter to this square wave which results in an acceptable
spectrum. See this [ipython notebook] for more details on how the
`MODEM_TX_NCO_MODE` parameters are chosen et cetera. (The internal
filter is a 17-tap FIR filter that is by default configured as
gaussian.)
